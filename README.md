# 🖥️ Pi 5 Performance Dashboard
⭐️ If you like this project, give it a star!

A real-time system monitoring dashboard built for the Raspberry Pi 5, using **Flask**, **Socket.IO**, and **Chart.js**. Tracks key performance metrics including CPU usage, memory, temperature, fan speed, network I/O, disk activity, and PMIC power draw — all in a sleek, dark-themed UI.
All you need for Raspberry Pi 5 monitoring.

⚙️ Lightweight by Design
This dashboard is built with efficiency in mind:

RAM Usage: Typically under 100MB total, including the Python runtime, Flask server, and WebSocket background updates.

CPU Impact: Negligible — system stats are fetched periodically with lightweight tools like psutil, avoiding constant polling or heavy shell loops.

Zero bloat: No heavy frameworks or services — just HTML, Bootstrap, Chart.js, and a minimal Flask backend.

Headless-optimized: Ideal for headless Raspberry Pi boards, even those with limited memory.

Self-cleaning: No background daemons, logs, or databases to maintain. All data is stored in memory and automatically resets on reboot.

The goal of this project is to provide a visually modern and extensible dashboard that stays well within the performance envelope of even a 2GB Pi board — while being easy to expand for custom use cases like Pi-hole stats, power monitoring, or even LLM integrations.
